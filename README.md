# Optimizing-Energy-Efficiency-Predicting-Heating-Load-in-Residential-Buildings

This project utilizes the R programming language and comprises four primary phases, which include Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Selection, Regression Analysis, and Model Evaluation.

The increasing demand for sustainable and energy-efficient buildings has led to a growing interest in the prediction and estimation of energy performance in residential buildings.

Heating load is a measure of the amount of heat required to maintain a comfortable indoor temperature in a building during the heating season.

By accurately predicting the amount of heat required to maintain a comfortable indoor temperature, they can adjust their heating systems accordingly, potentially saving on energy costs and reducing their carbon footprint.

Additionally, predicting heating load can be helpful in the design and construction of new buildings.
